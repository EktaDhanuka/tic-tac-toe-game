# tic-tac-toe-game
Tic Tac Toe in React.js is a simple web-based game built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The game consists of a 3x3 grid where two players take turns marking cells with "X" and "O". The goal is to get three of your marks in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally — before your opponent does. React’s component-based architecture makes it easy to manage the game state, update the UI in real-time, and implement features like move history or winner detection.
